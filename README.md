# Potential Enigma
This is the first in a series of repos I'll be making where I create a program based on github's recommended reposetory name!

The first repo recommendation is 'potential-enigma'. This is a tougher one, and I'm thinking of turning this into a program that creates difficult riddles to be solved.
This project is in progress, but feel free to contribute in any way you feel approriate!
